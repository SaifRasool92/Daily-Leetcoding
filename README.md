# Daily_LeetCoding

Welcome to the Daily_LeetCoding repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of solving LeetCode problems on a daily basis. By consistently tackling these coding challenges, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency.

## About

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems categorized by their respective difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Each problem solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the approach taken and the reasoning behind it. Additionally, you will find code implementations in popular programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++.

## Why Daily_LeetCoding?

- **Skill Enhancement**: Regular practice of problem-solving enhances algorithmic thinking and coding skills.
- **Learning Experience**: Explaining solutions helps in better understanding of concepts and techniques.
- **Consistency**: Daily practice builds momentum and consistency, leading to better long-term results.
- **Community Engagement**: Sharing solutions and insights fosters collaboration and learning within the programming community.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- A package manager like `pip` to install dependencies.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/SaifRasool92/Daily-Leetcoding.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv

    ```

4. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the solution in your Python environment:
    ```bash
    python solution.py
    ```

2. Example usage:
    ```python
    solution = Solution()
    result = solution.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
    print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
    ```
